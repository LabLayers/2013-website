<div>Published 1 October 2013, 10:35PM EST<br><br>Clients,<br>
<br>
If you are running any PHP-based CMS solution (including WordPress) and getting a NIST-related error, like this:
</div>
<blockquote style="border-left: 2px solid lightGray; margin-left: 0px; padding-left: 20px;">2007 0_FATAL_ERROR(); The page at time.gov returned: <h1>National Institute of Standards and Technology</h1> NIST Closed, NIST and Affiliated Web Sites Not Available Due to a lapse in government funding, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is closed and most NIST and affiliated web sites are unavailable until further notice. We sincerely regret the inconveniencee The National Vulnerability Database site will continue to be available. A limited number of other web sites may also be availablee Notice will be posted here (www.nist.gov) once operations resume. You may also get updates on NIST's operating status by calling (301) 975-8000e Conferences and other events scheduled during the shutdown are postponed or cancelled. Even after NIST reopens, some NIST events may need to be rescheduled. Once access to NIST Web sites resumes, please see the Conferences and Events (http://www.nist.gov/allevents.cfm) list for updated information on specific events.</blockquote>
<br>
Or this:<br>
<blockquote style="border-left: 2px solid lightGray; margin-left: 0px; padding-left: 20px;"><b>Warning</b>: Division by zero in <b>/xphp/functions.php</b> on line <b>1202</b></blockquote>

<br>I am completely aware of it. I was never aware that the US government shutdown would have such drastic effects on my clients and I apologize for any inconvenience this may have cause.<br>
<br>
I will be continually working on a solution for the next hour ASAP, and then after a 5-hour sleep, because of school. I will be working on it all day tomorrow as much (before, during, and after school) as much as I can until I make things right.<br>
<br>
It's not as simple as changing a string of code, since time.gov is unfortunately hard-coded into most of my themes I create. I will....<br><br>
<ul><li>Hide the error from the public while I find a solution. Some dates will not be visible to the guest, but it is better than having a page full of error.
</li><li>Synchronize the clock for your PHP server, and set it so that it runs on its own while synchronizing every day.</li><li>Implement a fail-proof time synchronization system that, which if the time failed to synchronize then it would not affect the current time.</li><li>Create a system that relies on multiple servers.</li><li>Format the dates so that they do not require division in storage.
</li></ul>I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused, and I understand that this is unacceptable for my customers. Should you have any questions/comments/concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
