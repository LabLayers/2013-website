      <h1>How many potatoes are in a bag of chips?</h1>
      Let's find out.

    </div></header>
    <section id="1">
      <img src="1.jpg" alt="bag">
      <span>
        <h1>One bag of   chips</h1>
        This bag has 220 grams of chips. 
      </span>
    </section>
    <section id="2">
      <img src="2.jpg" alt="potato">
      <span>
        <h1>One potato</h1>
        Here is the potato at 220 grams. (It was a strange coincidence that the potato I chose weighed the same as the bag of chips. I wish the numbers were different, so that my equations are a little more clear.)
      </span>
    </section>
    <section id="3">
      <img src="3.jpg" alt="potato slicer">
      <span>
        <h1>Slice it</h1>
        I sliced it using a potato slicer. 
      </span>
    </section>
    <section id="4">
      <img src="4.jpg" alt="sliced potato">
      <span>
        <h1>Done slicing</h1>
        Most of the slices are shaped exactly like chips, but a few are half sliced or broken.
      </span>
    </section>
    <section id="5">
      <img src="5.jpg" alt="salt">
      <span>
        <h1>1/2 teaspoon of salt</h1>
        I sprinkled some salt on the potato slices and shook them around in a container with a lid.
      </span>
    </section>
    <section id="6">
      <img src="6.jpg" alt="chip ring">
      <span>
        <h1>Stacked on the chip ring</h1>
        I had enough slices to fill this 1.5 times. I made sure to include every little misshapen chunk that I sliced. (I bought the potato slicer and chip ring on Deal Extreme for a few bucks.)
      </span>
    </section>
    <section id="7">
      <img src="7.jpg" alt="microwave">
      <span>
        <h1>Into the microwave</h1>
        A full chip ring takes about 7 minutes to cook, the half ring takes about 5 minutes. It's a little bit of trial and error.
      </span>
    </section>
    <section id="8">
      <img src="8.jpg" alt="scale">
      <span>
        <h1>Cooked chip weigh-in</h1>
        The cooked weight of the potato was about 45 grams.
      </span>
    </section>
    <section id="9">
      <img src="9.jpg" alt="cooked chips">
      <span>
        <h1>Mmmmm</h1>
        As you can see, I burnt them a little, but they are really, really good! You wouldn't believe that they are cooked in a microwave with no oil or additives besides a dash of salt.
      </span>
    </section>
    <section id="10">
      <img src="10.jpg" alt="chip ring">
      <span>
        <h1>8 potatoes = 1 bag of chips</h1>
        Doesn't that sound scary?
      </span>
    </section>
    <footer id="11" style="background:#8e44ad;"><div class="container">
      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      The potato went from 220 grams to 45 grams after cooking. The bag of chips contains 220 grams, or about 5 times the amount of chips that I cooked from the single potato. I weighed some of my remaining potatoes (5 x 220 grams=1100 grams) and came up with 8 small-medium potatoes needed to create the equivalent of one bag of chips.
      <br>
      <br>
      As someone who can easily demolish an entire bag of chips during a lunch period, this is a good reminder to STOP DOING THAT. Eight potatoes in one sitting is not a snack.
