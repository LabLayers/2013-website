    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <hr>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span>1</span>
          Obtain three shiny pennies.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>2</span>
          A small beaker in your lab tray contains of granulated zinc and zinc chloride solution. <i>CAUTION: Zinc chloride can damage skin!  If any of it gets on your skin, immediately flush with cold tap water.</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>3</span>
          Using tongs, carefully lower two clean copper pennies (2 for each student) into the solution in the beaker.  <i>DO NOT drop the coins into the solution! Avoid causing a splash.  Make sure the coins are touching the granulated zinc.</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>4</span>
          Cover the beaker with a watch glass. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>5</span>
          Light the Bunsen burner and place it under the wire stand. <i>Remember Bunsen burner Safety!</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>6</span>
          Gently heat the solution until it just begins to bubble, continue gentle bubbling for approximately five minutes. <i>DO NOT ALLOW the solution to boil vigorously or become heated to dryness. You will notice a change in the appearance of the pennies during this time.</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>7</span>
          The third penny is a CONTROL, an untreated penny needed for comparison.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>8</span>
          Fill a second beaker with cold tap water.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>9</span>
          With tongs, remove the two pennies (2 for each student) from the solution. Place them both in the beaker with cold tap water.  Turn off the burner but do not discard the zinc chloride solution. (When cooled, return the beaker with the solution to your lab tray)
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>10</span>
          Using tongs, remove the coins from the beaker of water. Gently tap dry with a paper towel.  Set one silver coin aside for comparison with the UNTREATED penny.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>11</span>
          Grab the second dry silver penny by its sides with the tongs and briefly heat the in the burner flame,  gently moving it back and forth, as shown by your teacher.  Heat only until you observe a change. <i>DO NOT OVERHEAT.</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>12</span>
          Immediately immerse the heated coin and tongs in the beaker of cold tap water.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>13</span>
          Remove the penny from the beaker and gently dry with a paper towel.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>14</span>
          Show all three pennies to your teacher for lab credit.
        </li>
      </ul>
